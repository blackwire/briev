Developer Toolkit

A basic set of tools that get used in my trade day in and day out. Color picker/converter, character entity lookup, clipboard utilities (multi-clipboard using CtrlorCmd+1/CtrlorCmd+2 to switch), clipboard history, clipboard to file conversion and file to clipboard conversion, a basic automation tool, and a task scheduler (that requires the app to be open at the moment).
